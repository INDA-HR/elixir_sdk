defmodule inda_hr.Model.History do
  @moduledoc """
  This object contains the history data according to the requested filters. If *Detail* has been set *true* in the request, an array of objects is returned. Each object is composed by the following fields, unless some aggregations have been requested: *APICall* (string), *Datetime* (string), *StatusCode* (int) and *Advanced* (boolean). If aggregation is performed, data is organized in nested objects (see the example below, where a *GroupBy* with *[\"advanced\", \"api_calls\"]* has been performed). Note that the *property name&ast;* shown in the response examples represents the API call name used to aggregate data if *api_calls* is set in the *GroupBy* field.
